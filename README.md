Project Overview: I am using an artificial neural network (ANN) in Python to predict whether customers of a bank will subscribe to a term deposit or not.

Dataset Overview: The banking dataset contains information about the customers of a bank, including their age, marital status, education, default history, balance, housing status, loan status, contact method, and other related information. The dataset has 7843 rows and 14 columns, with the last column indicating whether the customer subscribed to a term deposit or not.

Purpose of the Project: The purpose of the project is to build an ANN model that can accurately predict whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit or not.
